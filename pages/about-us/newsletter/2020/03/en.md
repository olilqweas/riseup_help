Walking with Riseup
------------------------------------

Your trust and support of Riseup through the last twenty years of us providing secure and safe communication tools to social movements warms our hearts and keeps us going during the hard, exhausting and often isolating work! Every day, we are constantly working to make sure your email works, your lists deliver and the VPN stays unblocked. We tend the infrastructure like a garden, pull weeds from the code, mulch the help tickets, pull the DDoS attack weeds, plant new servers and are ever vigilant against the spamming pests.

Right now, every month approximately 550 sustainers donate to Riseup. These regular contributions are essential to ensure our day-to-day efforts are sustained. To sustain Riseup is more than just making your donation - it means you are walking with us in our collective struggle to build and maintain social justice movement infrastructure through mutual aid.

Safety, security and privacy should be enjoyed by all - not just the people who can pay! In supporting each other, we build stronger communities around the world.

Increased monthly sustainers means Riseup will better be able to maintain the services we offer to social movements worldwide. Our goal is to have 600 monthly sustainers by the end of March, can you help us get there? We hope you can join us reaching this goal, in any way you can!
