Fundraising successful!
-----------------------

Our fundraising campaign has been a little nontraditional this year. We are wrapping it up with this email and want all of the people and movements that use Riseup’s services to rally and appreciate the things that we are accomplishing together.

So far, 2020 has proven to be a pretty intense year… It is heartening to see people come together and engage in mutual aid and solidarity. We see a silver lining in these difficult times. In a time where most of us are being left behind by the rich and powerful, we hear serious talks of a general strike. Together, people are moving to stand up to them.

We know this comes at a hard time for many people and some of you need to keep your own efforts alive. Riseup would not be possible without you all, or without the hard work that our communities do in movements around the world. We want to thank you all for your dedication and focus on making the world a better place in all the various ways that you do. If you are someone who is less affected, please consider helping keep activism alive as the daily struggle becomes more difficult.

Our goal to reach 600 monthly donors by the end of March not only succeeded, but we made it to 650. A heartfelt thank you to the folks who have committed to sustained support throughout the year. Our goal to enhance our VPN services succeeded. All in all, we raised 25% of the funds it requires to keep Riseup's lights on.

It's never too late to donate! The funds you send us are directly used to increase our services' quality and help the activist community.
