Riseup VPN
-----------------------------------------------

The Riseup VPN has been incredibly popular since we announced it last June. Many more users are now getting the benefits of more privacy, censorship circumvention, and location anonymization. This service has become so popular we now have a problem, the servers are overloaded!

On top of that, the way the internet was designed is giving us trouble. The majority of the internet infrastructure connecting South America to the rest of the world travels through Miami. Incredibly, even connections from South America often travel to Miami and back! Although we established a server in Miami for our VPN service to best support our users in South America, it has become incredibly overloaded and can’t keep up.

Fortunately, these problems are pretty easy to solve – we can get a higher performance server for Miami and pay for more bandwidth. For this to happen, we need your help. Donations made to our VPN account will go directly to solving these issues – https://riseup.net/vpn/donate
