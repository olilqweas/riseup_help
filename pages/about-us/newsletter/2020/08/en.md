Feedback and Support
-------------------------------

There are a few ways we get user feedback. The help tickets people create at support.riseup.net and the lovely notes that are sent in with the donations that keep our servers online and your email working. We also received a grant to do preliminary academic research through interviews with activists in South America. Right now, we are asking you to take a moment and let us know if there is something you love about a service (mail, lists, vpn, crabgrass, pad, share) that we provide? Or maybe you'd like to see us do something a little differently? Please understand we may not be able to make the changes you want - improving our services takes time and caution - but we won't know if you don't tell us. So, if you've got something you want to share about the services we provide, send us a note at outreach@riseup.net.

Improvements to riseup-vpn for android!
---------------------------------------

Do you have an android device? Did you know that riseup-vpn is available in f-droid, our website: https://riseup.net/vpn and the google play store? Did you know it is free to use?

A new version was just released adding a number of great features. It will now connect automatically to the closest gateway, which can result in faster speeds; you can tether over bluetooth and wifi to offer people a wifi access point that will send all the data over the VPN; UI improvements for starting/stopping via the pull-down menu; updated software and updated translations! Somehow, even with all of that it is now 1/3rd the size it was before.

You can also use riseup-vpn on Linux, Windows and Mac as well!

Onion v2 deprecation
------------------------------

Tor is deprecating v2 onions (see https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline ), so we are as well. If you use onion addresses to connect to riseup, check that you have transitioned to the v3 addresses: https://riseup.net/en/security/network-security/tor#riseups-tor-onion-services. The v3 addresses are easy to spot, they are the long ones!

We need your financial support
--------------------------------------------

Every year we grow a little bit more. More people use riseup each year as we take on new services and maintain additional systems. If you can, please make a donation to Riseup Networks in support of the services people use around the world as they struggle against capitalism and other forms of oppression. https://riseup.net/en/donate

If you want to directly support the research, testing and development of the software that Riseup Networks depends on to provide its services, please consider making a donation to Riseup Labs - the sibling organization that focuses on software research and development. https://riseuplabs.org/donate
