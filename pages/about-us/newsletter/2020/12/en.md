Let's do this together
----------------------

It's been a crazy year. We take heart as we act with everyone standing strong against state repression, the lies of politicians and the thugs paid by the state to murder innocent people. May the rage that burns in us fuel our passion and light our way!

Disrespecting the natural world results in illness and climate change, and we want to take a moment to pay our respects to everyone who has been affected by the turbulence.

Though neo-fascists, q-anon zombies and your angry uncle might say the movement is funded by Soros, the reality is that we are not, we just scrape by through the support of people like you. Every year we have an annual fundraiser to support the communication services that riseup provides, and it's that time again. There are a variety of ways to make financial donations to riseup, which you can find at https://riseup.net/en/donate.

We also welcome other contributions. Artists who can spare the time to help with graphic design, printers who can help print t-shirts or stickers, programmers that develop software we use and fix some of the bugs you find and translators who can help us make our communications more accessible are ways you can make a contribution to riseup and movements around the world. If you’d like to donate your labor, please send a note to outreach@riseup.net. It's hard to express how grateful we are to those that already donate their energy and time.

We also ask you to think outside the box. Do you have a wealthy aunt who believes in truth and justice – maybe you could ask her to make a tax-deductible donation on your behalf to Riseup Labs, the sibling organization that focuses on maintaining and developing the software that makes Riseup Networks' services possible ? If you work for a fancy software company, can you make a donation that will be matched by your employer? Perhaps you can encourage like-minded coworkers to do so as well! https://riseuplabs.org/donate

Throughout our fundraising appeal, we’ll be sending out "thank you" boxes with some goodies to random donors. Everyone who donates during our fundraiser will be entered into a raffle, and several lucky people will randomly be selected to receive a box full of surprises. If you make a donation through liberapay, snail mail, cryptocurrency or wire payment, please send a note to raffle@riseup.net or we won’t have a way to contact you.

A huge thank you to the amazing groups that have contributed to the raffle prizes – our lovely friends at PM Press, Feminazgul, Justseeds, Microcosm Publishing, Arise Botanicals, AK Press, Slingshot Collective & Eberhardt Press.

Take flight with us
-------------------

The communication services that riseup provides are pretty unique - we don't charge, we don't exploit our users for profit and we work to minimize data so it can't be leveraged by oppressive powers. If you want to learn more about the services we provide - email, lists, crabgrass, vpn, etherpads and more - take a moment to visit https://riseup.net/en/about-us/projects.

Financial support from thousands of people is what keeps the riseup boat afloat. If you are able, please consider making a donation at https://riseup.net/en/donate. The riseup birds - the folks keeping the servers running, the support tickets answered, the vpn hiding your web history, and your digital whispers quiet - will match your funds with blood, sweat, tears and dedication.

Why we do this – 20 years of Riseup
-----------------------------------

We don't spend much time talking about what we do. Or why making free, secure communication tools available for everyone fighting oppression around the world is important. We are excited to provide and improve collaboration tools to make your (and our) actions building a better world a little easier.

It has been 20 years now that riseup has been active in the movements around the world, and we aren't going away. We need your financial support to enable us to continue carrying the digital shields and umbrellas, while offering you tools to force oppression back into its cold, concrete hole. If you can, please visit https://riseup.net/donate and make a financial contribution.

If you're curious about riseup, and want to read some of the things we've been public about, there is a list of our press releases and related articles at https://riseup.net/en/about-us/press. You can also read our newsletter archive at https://riseup.net/en/about-us/newsletter.

Shhhh, it is your right to whisper
----------------------------------

Did you ever tell someone a secret when you were a kid, only to have the whole neighborhood find out? If so, it probably hurt and made life hard for a while - we hope you were able to reconcile, heal and learn from this experience. Capitalist communication providers have created a business from gathering and telling our secrets - recording everything we do and offering it for sale. When our data is sold to anyone who has the cash to pay for it, a breach of trust is created that won't be fully realized until it is too late – for activists and journalists this can be fatal.

Everyone needs free, accessible, and secure communications. Riseup is one of the few providers who actively works to protect our ability to whisper, to think and to act without requiring payment – we also don't trick you into thinking you have a truly free service, while actually colluding with oppressive forces. We will never sell, mine or exploit your data - we'll help keep your secrets so that you can focus on fighting oppression.

It is unfortunate that we can't do this on love and rage alone. Bandwidth, equipment, electricity and food for the birds all require money in our current system. If you are able, please make a donation and keep Riseup's secure communications online, free and accessible - https://riseup.net/donate
