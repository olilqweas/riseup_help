This isn't possible without your help
-------------------------------------

Our fundraiser has been short and sweet this year, as usual we've had a difficult time asking for financial support - there have been more important things demanding our attention. Thank you so much, we are always amazed at the commitment and contribution of people using riseup's services!

We all play a vital role in our own ways. From the frontlines of street protests to the toolsheds in community gardens, there are so many things that folks that depend on our services do to make the world a better place. Many thanks to everyone who is working hard to create the world that we know is possible. 

A special thank everyone who has made a donation during this fundraising drive. If you haven't had an opportunity to yet, it's never too late! If you can, please take a moment and make a financial contribution - https://riseup.net/donate.
