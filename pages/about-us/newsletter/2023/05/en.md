Whose services? Our services!!!
-------------------------------

For each of the services that we offer – email, lists, crabgrass, pad, share, and vpn – there are a myriad of layers underneath the user interface. There is the core infrastructure that we maintain, like routers, servers, virtual machines, administrative software. Then there are the day to day tasks that we must do to ensure the service stays up and running. In some instances, we are the authors of the software or we have code that we create ourselves to make everything work.

A lot of our work is pretty invisible, but if this work doesn’t happen the services will bit-rot, and eventually fail.

If you can, please make a donation in support of our work. If you would like to make a tax-deductible donation to support the research and development that goes into the software running our services, please visit https://riseuplabs.org/en/donate. If you just want to support the services directly, please visit https://riseup.net/donate.

Help us, help you
-----------------

Riseup is inherently opposed to using the tools capitalist tech companies develop to analyze and exploit the "customers" that use their "free" services. Riseup doesn't have customers, we have allies and comrades. For us, the important work is making communication services available as we build the world we know is possible, rather than gathering data to exploit you for profit. 

We ask that you make a financial contribution, if you can afford it.

And for those who can donate, consider covering the costs for someone who can't. If you are an organization, have a high traffic list, use tons of pads for your work, please consider including us in your budget - the infrastructure we are providing you is worth so much more that what you would be paying to one of the big tech corporations. 

If you can, please provide some financial support via https://riseup.net/donate.
