November 2023 Riseup Newsletter 
-------------------------------

So much phishing, don't get hooked

We routinely get reports of phishing emails that are targeting riseup users, and we saw an unusual amount last month. Please be careful with emails that tell you to click on links and only open attachments that you are expecting - be they for riseup services, or other services. We wanted to remind you that it is very unusual for riseup to contact you directly with such a request. If you ever have a question about the authenticity about an email you receive, please create a ticket at https://support.riseup.net.


Backup your data

We understand that not everyone that uses our services can not make a backup of their data - but if you can, please make sure you backup your data. For most people, this means using an email client to make an offline copy of your emails and making a backup copy of your pads using a text editor on your computer or phone. 

We do our best to make our services durable, secure and efficient - we think we've been doing alright for the past two decades. Sometimes things go wrong, and the state always looms in the background - so please be prepared and backup your data.

A big shout out to everyone else around the planet struggling to make another world possible. We do our best to provide us with communications services to help make our work more effective. If you can, please consider making a donation - https://riseup.net/donate.
