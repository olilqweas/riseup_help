Riseup's History
----------------

"What can we do to create the world our hearts yearn to live in?" Some birds asked themselves this, after living an exhausting and exhilarating week of protests against the World Trade Organization almost 25 years ago. There was, and still is, so much work to do that the answer became crystal clear: put our knowledge and skills to help build justice movements around the world. That was the start of riseup.net.

In the beginning it was simple, hosting e-mail and mailing lists for groups and friends. We wanted to fight corporate power, not depend on it. To do so, we created our own autonomous communication services, so our communities could use them to agitate. New birds joined our flock during this time, bringing their individual strengths as they joined in our collective struggle.

We weren't the only ones doing this kind of work, grassroots tech collectives were present in different parts of the globe with movements embracing the beautiful process of creating power. We had conversations regarding the role of technology in movement building, on how technology should have systems that are based on protecting and serving people's needs — rather than exploitation. 

We joined new endeavors and started to develop software, Crabgrass was our take on the "web 2.0" trend, a set of tools to help groups with their tasks. We started hosting "pad", a very easy to use collaborative writing tool. We tried, and failed, to create an easy to use end-to-end encrypted tool using mail. During this time, our flock grew way beyond the boundaries of the city of Seattle.

We were now facing the question, what's next? The internet had changed vastly since the early 2000s. Big Tech started to provide features we were never able to, at the same time we were able to provide Big Tech's worst dream — no user tracking. Snowden leaks brought an increase of users and demands for our systems. Reflecting on these support requests we started to focus our effort on improving services. We enabled larger mail storage that can only be read with your user password, and with the help of LEAP now it's more easier than ever to use our VPN service.

Over the past couple years, we have been dealing with growing pains and the need to understand and overcome technical debt that has built up over time. Maintenance work is not as exciting as launching something new, but it needs to be done. Behind the scenes, we have been working non-stop on making our services more reliable, improving our mail infrastructure, and making our user support as useful as possible. As always, we continue fighting spammers and trying to push forward the new world our hearts still demand.
