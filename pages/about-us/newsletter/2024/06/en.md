Amidst the whirlwind of transitions and the arrival of new birds to the flock, we pause to consider how your support has sustained us throughout.

We'll be candid: asking for financial assistance isn't something that comes naturally to us. Yet, as we navigate the challenges and celebrate the triumphs, we recognize the indispensable role that your generosity plays in fueling our mission.

Sometimes we are asked what a proportional share of the cost of our services might be. The truth is, putting a price tag on the impact of our collective efforts feels unacceptable. Our project is fueled by the love, rage and determination that each of us brings to the table. This is not something that can be adequately assessed through a financial lens.

Whether you've dedicated your time to riseup, contributed financially, or used our services to organize for a better world, your involvement is what truly defines us. Together, we are a community driven by a shared vision of a better world, united in our determination to turn that vision into reality.

Supporting our communities' ability to communicate is what is important to us. If you haven't taken the opportunity yet, it's never too late to make a financial contribution - https://riseup.net/donate. 

Thank you to everyone who is contributing to making the world be what we know it should be, in whatever way you are.
