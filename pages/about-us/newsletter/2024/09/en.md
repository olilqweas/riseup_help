September 2024 Riseup Newsletter
--------------------------------

1. Get us a birthday gift – tell us about your history with Riseup!

Riseup will soon have its 25th birthday! We have made it through good and bad times with one goal in mind: to support the lovely people, like you, fighting for another world. Riseup is what it is because of all of you!

For our birthday we’d love to hear how you got to know riseup, why you’re happy we’re still around. We send a warm thank you to those that sent in their stories already – you inspire us to keep going! And we’d like to hear more, so don’t waste time, pick up that keyboard, type away and send us an email at outreach@riseup.net. o/

Over the upcoming months, we will share some of the stories that you all have shared with us as we celebrate our 25 years in providing communication services for the struggle we are all engaged in.

2. RiseupVPN release update

Our awesome friends at the LEAP Encryption Access Project (https://leap.se) have been working hard on improving the software many of you use with our VPN service and there is now a new release of the VPN client, RiseupVPN! LEAP has been working hard to eliminate technical debt, streamline its codebase, update documentation, improve user interfaces, and to bring the desktop application up to speed with the mobile versions. In the near future, LEAP will also be optimizing gateway performances by integrating new load balancing features.

LEAP not only develops and maintains RiseupVPN, but also the backend VPN platform, Lilypad. As Riseup integrates LEAP’s work, you will also be able to use new circumvention technology, some of which will be available this fall and other will continue to be included in LEAP’s additional releases over the next year.

While LEAP develops the VPN software, Riseup has to implement it, coordinate the underlying infrastructure and make it available to you. If you would like to make a donation to LEAP directly to support their development work of our VPN, please visit https://leap.se/donate/. For more info about RiseupVPN, please visit riseup.net/vpn.

3. Time to pass the hat! Can you make a contribution?

Running Riseup services takes a lot of labor and financial resources, so if you’re in a position to make a donation, even the smallest amount, that’d be really helpful. We provide all of our communication services free of charge, but we have to have your help to make that possible. If you can, please take a moment and make a financial contribution towards the work that Riseup does to make another world possible. riseup.net/donate
