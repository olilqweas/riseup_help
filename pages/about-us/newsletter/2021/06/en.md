June 2021 Riseup Newsletter
---------------------------

Riseup Status Page: https://riseupstatus.net

We had some frustrating technical issues this year and we noticed we didn't have a direct way to communicate to you what was going on while we were working on resolving them. To solve this, we created a new place to find the most up-to-date information about service interruptions.

Bookmark https://riseupstatus.net so you can quickly see if we already know about problems with Riseup services!

Service deprecation reminder

Riseup will continue providing email service, as we have for the past 20 years, however we are deprecating the Squirrelmail interface. Don't know what Squirrelmail is? Then you don't need to worry about this!

If you would like to know more about the Squirrelmail deprecation, please visit https://riseup.net/email/webmail/squirrelmail. Additionally, as mentioned in the previous newsletter, the XMPP and the “red” VPN services will also be deprecated.
