September 2021 Riseup Newsletter
--------------------------------

Tidying up our nest

As COVID-19 hit the planet our lives increasingly moved from the streets to the internet, and there was a much greater demand for our services. Riseup wasn't prepared for that and we responded as fast as we could trying to live up to your expectations. Since then we have been working hard to make our services even more adaptable, increasing our reliability and making your user experience a little less terrible in these remote-work times.

Behind the scenes there is a lot of hard work being done to bring stability to our services. We've been upgrading our hardware and updating our infrastructure to keep up with the times, for example our monitoring system improvements are enabling us to resolve problems quicker. We have been moving forward but there is still a lot to do, but we wanted to let you know why we have been quiet all these months.

We can't wait to see you more and more in the streets again. Stay safe!

We love our communities

We love our communities and the communities that we support around the world. Riseup developed as a radical leftist response to corporate and state repression during popular protests against the WTO in 1999, and our values and purpose reflect that. If you would like to have a better understanding of who we are, or why we exist, please visit https://riseup.net/about-us.

It shouldn't be be a surprise that we will close accounts spreading transphobia, homophobia, racism, sexism or any other kind of vile activity. We need to be clear, we do this work for a reason and even just having an offensive username or alias is contrary to our purpose.

Passing the donation bucket

We aren't any good at asking for money, and it shows. We reuse hardware as much as possible, don't rent office space, or provide equipment to staff. We would much rather be engaging in revolution than engaging in capitalism. So we make things work and occasionally make timid requests for your financial support. If you can, please help cover the costs of the services that riseup provides worldwide to activists, journalists, human rights defenders and other people like you who are trying to make the world a better place, one free of oppression. https://riseup.net/donate
