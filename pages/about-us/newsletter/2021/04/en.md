Service deprecation notice

This year we are deprecating a few Riseup services. The ones that will be going away are xmpp, squirrelmail and the "red" VPN. We are doing this because our labor resources are limited, we must prioritize services that are actively used by the largest number of users. If we cannot actively maintain a service, then it becomes irresponsible for us to continue to provide it. It jeopardizes you, and other Riseup users if it is not properly maintained. These services are used by a very few number of people, most have migrated to other chat software (eg. Matrix, Signal, DeltaChat), better mail options (roundcube, or a mail client), or the RiseupVPN. For those of you still using these old services, the time to start thinking about migrating off of them is now.

We want your feedback about the VPN

Riseup is currently looking for some folks to contribute user feedback and testing for our VPN service and the VPN client developed by LEAP Encryption Access Project. If you would like to participate or would like to give us your opinion about the VPN, please send us a note at outreach@riseup.net.

Contribute to cover our operating costs

Emails, lists, help tickets, vpn connections & gateways, crabgrass, etherpads, shared files... so many things are happening. We need your finanicial support for the electricity, hardware, software and labor required to keep Riseup's services online. If you can, please take time to make a donation in support of our work - https://riseup.net/donate
