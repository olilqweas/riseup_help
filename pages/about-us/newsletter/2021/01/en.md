Keep our software current, maybe with a matching donation?
----------------------------------------------------------

Software quickly becomes obsolete or insecure without maintenance. Much of the software that is used to run the services Riseup provides is either home-brewed or free software that needs to be adapted for the particular needs of the movements we support. If you like the services that Riseup offers we’d like you to consider making a donation to Riseup Labs - the sibling organization that focuses on maintaining and developing the software that makes Riseup Networks' services possible. https://riseuplabs.org/donate

For Riseup supporters who work for an employer with a matching donation program, please think of Riseup Labs. If you can't find us in the relevant registry, let us know and we’ll see what we can do to make it possible for you leverage your donations to Riseup Labs with matching donations from your employer.

Donations made to Riseup Labs, a 501©3 organization, are tax-deductible in the United States.

Now for the final push to get us to our fundraising goal, check out this inspiring video from our friendly co-conspirators: subMedia[0], Antimidia[1] and the broader Kolektiva [2] project – psssst, pass it on! https://riseup.net/en/about-us/propaganda/your-right-to-whisper

This year's fundraising has been a success due to everyone who has helped spread the word and made contributions. Riseup is a grassroots project that works to realize our vision in creating sustainable, secure communication services - we couldn't do this without your support! If you are able, please make a donation and keep Riseup's secure communications online, free and accessible - https://riseup.net/donate

We also want to send a huge hug/high-5/nod/shout-out to everyone actively engaged in the struggle: child care providers, copwatchers, designers, medics, online communicators, organizers, street bands, food/water/infrastructure providers, everyone out in the streets, the folks at home cheering the movement on, trainers, comrades dialoguing with those who don't know, the people fighting from within the system and other people working on developing, implementing secure communication systems and collaboration tools for our movements.

And a hearty thanks again to the wonderful people who contributed to the raffle - PM Press[3], Feminazgul[4], Justseeds[5], Microcosm Publishing[6], Arise Botanicals[7], AK Press[8], Slingshot Collective[9] & Eberhardt Press[10].

Here is to a 2021 full of victories. We'll see you in the streets!
