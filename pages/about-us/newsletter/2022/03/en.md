Who is taking notes?
--------------------

Many people are familiar with our email services, but might have never explored our pads - a real-time collaborative text editor. The service is super easy to use, just visit https://pad.riseup.net and in less than 5 seconds everyone in your meeting can share the note taking task, collaboratively draft a call to action, work on a fundraising appeal (we did!), or transfer text between devices. If there is a creative way you are using pads and want to let us know, please enlighten us at outreach@riseup.net.

Our pads have no advertisements, basic formatting tools, authorship colors, an editing timeline, a built-in chatbox, and are accessible with Tor hidden services. We don't collect any data or track your pads. All pads are automatically deleted after a period of not being used that you can set.

Contributions from people like you keep our pad service online, providing the resources needed to keep the data flowing between digital tools used to change the world. If you can, please make a contribution in support of the services that Riseup offers to people and movements around the world. https://riseup.net/donate

Sometimes collaboration happens in the most unexpected ways
-----------------------------------------------------------

At the intersection of greed and oppression, our arms are linked with everyone committed to build a better world. We realized years ago that communications is critical infrastructure that our movements need to reduce the control the state and corporations have over our lives, and is necessary for our organizing to thrive. 

This is why we work with other tech collectives around the world to autonomously create and operate our own communication systems built specifically around the needs of our communities. Not only is this important, but it effective! Our hearts flutter when we hear how our work has strengthened your organizing work. Collaboration is beautiful!

Can you collaborate with us by contributing towards building these vital resources that help our communities thrive? If you can, please visit https://riseup.net/donate.

P.S. We can always use help with translating our newsletters, website and other communications â€“ please send a note to outreach@riseup.net if you would like to contribute in this way.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!
-------------------------------------

This is our final email for this year's fundraising appeal. We want to thank you for the help you give us, and for the support you give movements around the world.

We also want to thank all of the friendly and amazing volunteers giving us a hand: those helping with support tickets, our awesome translators, the artists that have been giving us their art for years. The folks helping their friends use our services, to be more secure and more dangerous. The people that give us feedback. And each of you for your contributions of the huge task of building a different world.

Love and rage,

The riseup birds
