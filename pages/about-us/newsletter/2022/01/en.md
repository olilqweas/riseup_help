Our networks support and nurture us 
-----------------------------------

Our different realities make us sprout in divergent ways, just like the way forests develop an unique look according to their location. We are all part of an always growing and evolving ecosystem. Each of us makes contributions in synergistic ways, combining together to form rhizomatic dreams and build mycilial networks that branch out of our hard work and determination. Our collective efforts feed and network the lush growth above ground.

It is time for us to reach out on these networks to send a signal that riseup needs your help! We have been continuously working to develop and provide autonomous communications networks for over 20 years, and we have only been able to do that because of contributions from people like you. It is awesome to look back at decades of work coordinated with our comrades that enables our unique, free services. As part of the underground networks that support the blossoming world we all help create, we ask you to make a contribution to support services that riseup offers and the work that this all enables.

To be honest, writing this message is hard, it is not fun asking for money. However, it is necessary because riseup only exists through the contributions from people using our services. Small or big, any amount is helpful and welcome! Even better, if you can, help us support each other by contributing enough to cover another person using our services. If you can, please make a contribution at https://riseup.net/donate.

As another hard year draws to a close, riseup sends love and solidarity to those of you who have had your wings clipped, become burnt out, or are risking your lives to help your community!

Riseup lists encircle the world with your support!
--------------------------------------------------

Riseup hosts over seventeen thousand lists for over 3.5 million people who are organizing around the world. Our lists are used in many ways: fighting oppression; coordinating tasks in community housing or social centers; notices about protests, teach-ins, and other events; facilitating dialogue about current issues, paths of action or debating politics; writing together the next great manifesto; or newsletters like the ones we send to you. Unlike most other list providers, we do not mine your data, charge any fees or pollute your brain with advertisements.

When we first started offering list services there were many places offering them for free. Lists are difficult to provide and require a lot of maintenance, so over time many of the free services have been discontinued and corporate options have replaced them, often at a cost that would be prohibitive to the movements that we support. We are constantly working to improve our lists, providing support and responding to technical issues. If our list users were forced to pay for this service, millions of dollars would be diverted from movements around the world into the pockets of greedy capitalists.

We need your help to keep our lists going. We put a lot of love, blood, sweat and tears into lists that you and others like you around the world use to organize. This is movement infrastructure that we maintain and own, let's keep it autonomous! Can you to make a financial contribution to support lists? If so, please visit https://riseup.net/donate. A donation towards lists goes a long way, it leverages a small contribution on your behalf with our labor and equipment to help keep thousands of movements active and vibrant around the world â€“ while also keeping money and data away from the for-profit corporate world.
