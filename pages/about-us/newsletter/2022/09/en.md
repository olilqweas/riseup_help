Backup Backup Backup! Don't lose your data, don't lose your access

We sometimes get requests from people whose pad document got deleted because it expired. Other times folks haven't used their riseup email in several years, and they find out their account has gone dormant, or they can't remember their password anymore. In these situations, there is never anything that can be done - once your data is gone, it is gone forever - unless you have made a backup.

Please always make sure to back up your data! This includes your password manager, the documents in your computer and the data stored with us like email, crabgrass pages or pad documents!


VPNs come and go, but LEAP's in it for the long haul!

Our friends at LEAP have been hard at work on the software that makes the RiseupVPN service possible. Whether you are trying to get around a firewall, want to have greater privacy on a public network, or don't want to have your data mined - LEAP has made many new improvements to support you over the past year. They have incorporated a brand new user interface, faster connections with UDP support, new circumvention tech, and have also completely overhauled Lilypad (See 1, below), the software VPN providers like Riseup use.

We are excited to see LEAP's work over the upcoming years, they are always busy researching upcoming technical developments. Some of their focus currently includes blocking advertisements! You can make tax-deductible donations in support of LEAP's work through Riseup Labs at https://riseuplabs.org/leap or you can send LEAP a contribution directly at https://leap.se/donate/.


Please consider contributing to our infrastructure costs

There's a lot going on under the surface here in the riseup nest. We regularly maintain and improve hardware. Ensuring the software is functioning correctly requires that we are constantly paying attention to our services and incorporating updates and making other improvements. There are often day-to-day events we have to be responsive to as well, like protecting our services from DDoS attacks.

If you can, please take a moment and throw a little financial support to the work that Riseup does in support of liberatory social movements around the world. https://riseup.net/donate
